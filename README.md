#  Power BI project  - Bahrain Imports of Plastics (2020â€“2024) 


##  1. Problem Statement

From **2020 to 2024**, Bahrainâ€™s imports of plastics showed noticeable fluctuations due to changes in **industrial demand**, **oil price volatility**, and **global supply chain challenges**.

Although total imports reached **BD 769.88 million**, the countryâ€™s strong dependence on a few suppliers mainly **Saudi Arabia, China, and the UAE** exposes potential **supply risks** and emphasizes the need for **diversification and better cost management**.

This analysis explores **import patterns, supplier distribution, and pricing trends** using Power BI to support data-driven decision-making and enhance Bahrainâ€™s trade resilience.



##  2. Insights & Findings

1. **High concentration of imports:** Most imports come from **China and Saudi Arabia**, showing dependency on limited suppliers.
2. **Fluctuating import values:** 2022 recorded a major spike followed by a decline, indicating market instability.
3. **Price volatility:** Average import prices peaked in 2022 due to global oil and logistics disruptions.
4. **Stable demand:** Despite fluctuations, transaction volume remained steady (~64K), showing consistent industrial demand.
5. **Limited diversification:** Imports are focused on a narrow range of suppliers and commodities.



## ðŸ§­ 3. Recommendations

1. **Diversify import sources:** Explore new suppliers in **Europe and Southeast Asia** to reduce reliance on China and Saudi Arabia.
2. **Negotiate long-term trade contracts:** Secure **stable pricing and supply continuity** through consistent supplier agreements.
3. **Enhance regional collaboration:** Work with **GCC countries** to strengthen logistics and shared procurement efficiency.
4. **Promote sustainable imports:** Encourage importing **recycled or eco-friendly plastics** aligned with Bahrainâ€™s environmental goals.
5. **Continuous monitoring:** Regularly update the Power BI dashboard to track **price trends, supply risks, and growth performance**.
